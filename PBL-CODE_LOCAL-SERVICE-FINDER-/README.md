This project aims to develop a digital platform that directly connects local
service providers with consumers, focusing on bridging the gap in accessibility
and fairness within the service industry. The platform is designed to serve
middle-class households, offering essential services such as plumbing,
electrical work, maid services, mechanical repairs, air conditioning cleaning
and repairs, and pest control. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform
ensures that service providers receive the full payment for their work, fostering
a fairer compensation model. The goal is to create an affordable, efficient, and
transparent solution that benefits both clients and freelancers, providing a
faster and more economical way to access services.
Unlike existing platforms such as Urbanclap and Justdial, this platform
prioritizes direct payment to service providers, ensuring that no middleman
takes a cut. Success will be evaluated based on the percentage of local
service providers who adopt the platform within specific geographic areas,
with higher adoption rates indicating a successful implementation. The
platform will be launched in its full version from the start, with ongoing efforts
to continuously attract both service providers and clients, ensuring the
platform's sustainability and growth
